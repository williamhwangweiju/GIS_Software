# Swift Map
Welcome to the Geographic Information System (GIS) project repository! This project is part of a design course aimed at creating a powerful GIS software program to visualize and solve travel and optimization problems in maps of any city in the world.

Features:
1. Data Handling
Database Integration: Read and process a comprehensive database containing intersections, streets, and other geographic features of a city.
Data Structures: Organize geographic data into efficient and appropriate data structures for fast access and manipulation.
2. Map Visualization
Interactive Map: Render detailed city maps with options for user interaction.
User Controls: Enable panning, zooming, highlighting, and searching for locations within the map.
3. Route Optimization
Pathfinding: Compute optimal travel routes between intersections in the city and provide step-by-step directions to users.
Routing Algorithms: Implement and integrate advanced pathfinding algorithms to ensure efficient and accurate route computation.
4. Delivery Optimization
Delivery Scheduling: Determine the best order of deliveries for a courier based on a daily delivery list.
Route Planning: Design efficient driving paths for delivery drivers, minimizing travel time and distance.
